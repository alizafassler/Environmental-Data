On this assignment I worked with Sonja Glasser and Justin Roche.

# **Q1 (8 pts.): Submit the code you used to build your ANOVA by hand. Make sure you use the code template so that you use the same variable names as those which Iâ€™ll use for the grading.**

```{r}
rm(list = ls())

rope = read.csv(here("data", "rope.csv"))
rope$rope.type = factor(rope$rope.type)

n_obs = length(rope$rope.type)
n_groups = nlevels(rope$rope.type)

ss_tot = sum((mean(rope$p.cut) - rope$p.cut)^2)
df_tot = n_obs -1

agg_sq_resids = aggregate(
  x = rope$p.cut,
  by = list(rope$rope.type),
  FUN = function(x) sum((x - mean(x))^2))

ss_within = sum(agg_sq_resids$x)
df_within = n_obs - n_groups

ss_among = ss_tot - ss_within
df_among = df_tot-df_within


ms_among  =  ss_among / (n_groups - 1)
ms_within = ss_within / (n_obs - n_groups)

f_ratio = ms_among/ms_within
f_pval = 1 - pf(f_ratio, df_among, df_within)
```


```{r, include = FALSE}
#self check
digits_check = 5

# Build the reference model using R functions
fit_1 = lm(p.cut ~ rope.type, data=rope)
anova(fit_1)
anova_fit_1 = anova(fit_1)

# Check degrees of freedom
anova_fit_1$Df == c(df_among, df_within)

# Check sums of squares
round(anova_fit_1$`Sum Sq`, digits = digits_check) == round(c(ss_among, ss_within), digits = digits_check)

# Check mean squares
round(anova_fit_1$`Mean Sq`, digits = digits_check) == round(c(ms_among, ms_within), digits = digits_check)

# Check the F-ratio
round(anova_fit_1$`F value`[1], digits = digits_check) == round(f_ratio, digits = digits_check)

# Check the F test statistic p-value
round(anova_fit_1$`Pr(>F)`[1], digits = digits_check) == round(f_pval, digits = digits_check)
```

# **Q2 (1 pt.): Examine the conditional boxplot in the Partitioning Variance: Within-Group section of the walkthrough. Based on the figure, do you think there are equal variances among the groups?**
Based on the boxplot it looks like the rope type groups do not have equal variance. For example, the "blaze" group has a much greater spread compared to the "PI" group which has much less spread in the data and therefore less variance.

# **Q3 (1 pt.): Conduct a Bartlett test to assess the homoteneity of variances in the rope type groups. Report the p-value.**
```{r}
bartlett.test(p.cut ~ rope.type, data=rope)
```
P-value = 0.00143

# **Q4 (2 pts.): Given your graphical assessment (question 2) and the Bartlett test, do you think an ANOVA-type analysis is appropriate on the raw data? Explain why or why not.**

Based on the boxplot and significant p-value from the bartlett test, I do not think an ANOVA-type analysis is appropriate for the raw data since it violates the homogeneity assumption. Transforming the data by using for example a log transformation may stabilize the variance because the groups with higher medians seem to have more spread. 


# **Q5 (1 pt.): Which rope type is the base case?**

Blaze is the base case.

# **Q6 (1 pt.): What is the mean percent cut of the base case rope? Show your calculation using value(s) from the model coefficient table.**

The mean percent cut for the base case is the estimate = 0.36714.


# **Q7 (1 pt.): What is the mean percent cut rope type XTC? Show your calculation using value(s) from the model coefficient table.**
```{r}
 #The mean percent cut is the estimate for the base case minus the estimate for the XTC case.
0.36714-0.10164
```
